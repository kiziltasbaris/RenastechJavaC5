What is the difference between Abstract vs Interface?

---Both help us to achieve abstraction in Java and both cannot be instantiated.

---Abstract Class is a class and and can be partially abstract since it can include concrete methods.

---Interface is pure abstraction since there is no concrete method in it and it is just like a blueprint for the class
implementing it.Interface can have abstract methods,default methods,static methods,and public final static variables.

---We can extend only one Abstract class but when we want to use an interface , we may implement as many interfaces as we want.
