What is the difference between stack and heap?

---Java heap space is used throughout the application,but stack is only used for the method or methods currently running.

---The heap space contains all objects are created,but Stack contains any reference to those objects.

--Object stored in the Heap can be accessed throughout the application.Primitive local variables are only accessed the
Stack memory blocks that contain their methods.

---Memory allocation in the Heap Space is accessed through a complex, young-generation, old generation system.
Stack is accessed through a last-in, first-out (LIFO) memory allocation system.

---Heap space exists as long as the application runs and  is larger than Stack,which is temporary,but faster.

---The Heap Space contains all objects are created,but stack contains any reference to those objects.

---Objects stored in the Heap can be accessed throughout the application.

---Primitive local variables are only accessed the Stack Memory blocks that contain their methods.
